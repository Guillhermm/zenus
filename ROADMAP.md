# Zenus Roadmap

**Vision**: An operating system driven by intent, not commands.

This roadmap outlines planned improvements across all phases of Zenus development — from the current system layer to the long-term goal of Zenus becoming a full operating system. All ideas are aspirational; implementation priority is determined by impact and feasibility.

Dates are stated as **maximum targets**, not promises. Phase 1 was originally scheduled for Q2 2026 and was completed in March 2026 — earlier phases can shift later ones earlier, but we do not adjust remaining targets optimistically until work is underway.

## Phase 1.5: Pre-Launch Hardening — target: by June 2026

These items were identified before the first public release. All are prerequisite to promoting Zenus broadly: they close known gaps, harden security, and improve interoperability with the current AI tooling ecosystem.

### 1.5.1 Security Audit & Hardening

- [x] **OWASP Top-10 audit** ✅ (`zenus_core/` full sweep — v1.1.0)
  - A01 Broken Access Control: privilege tiers reviewed; path traversal closed via `Path.resolve()`
  - A03 Injection: URL scheme validation in NetworkOps; temp-file permissions hardened in CodeExec
  - A08 Software & Data Integrity: `enforce_confirmation_policy()` ensures risk≥2 always requires confirmation
  - A09 Logging & Monitoring: secret masking in audit logs and intent history; owner-only file permissions
  - GitHub token restricted to env-only (no config.yaml fallback)
  - 30 regression tests in `tests/unit/test_security.py`

### 1.5.2 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

- [x] **MCP server mode** ✅ (`zenus_core/mcp/server.py` — v1.2.0)
  - `FastMCP`-based server mapping every tool action to an MCP tool descriptor
  - Tool names: `{ToolName}__{action_name}` (e.g. `FileOps__read_file`)
  - Privilege tiers enforced: privileged tools (ShellOps, CodeExec) excluded by default
  - Configurable via `mcp.server.*` in `config.yaml`; start with `zenus mcp-server`
  - Supports `stdio` transport and `sse` transport (HTTP clients)
- [x] **MCP client mode** ✅ (`zenus_core/mcp/client.py` — v1.2.0)
  - `MCPClientRegistry` discovers remote tools from external MCP servers at startup
  - Tools injected as `mcp__{server}__{tool}` into the Zenus tool registry
  - `config.yaml` `mcp.client.servers` list; `stdio` and `sse` transports supported
- [x] Updated `docs/TOOLS.md` and `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` with MCP setup guide ✅

### 1.5.3 Voice Completion

- [ ] **TTS finalization** (`packages/voice/tts.py`)
  - Piper TTS: complete streaming output (start speaking before LLM finishes)
  - Voice profile support (speed, pitch) configurable via `config.yaml`
  - Graceful fallback chain: Piper → system TTS (`espeak`) → silent
- [ ] **Conversational flow** (`packages/voice/pipeline.py`)
  - Clarifying questions mid-execution: pipeline pauses and speaks the question, waits for STT answer
  - Natural interruption: detect "stop", "cancel", "wait" during TTS playback and halt execution
  - Context carryover: pronouns and references ("do it again", "and then X") resolved against prior `VoiceSession` turns

### 1.5.4 Parallel Execution — Benchmarks & UX

- [ ] **Concrete benchmarks**: measure and document real wall-clock speedups for representative parallel workloads (batch file ops, multi-package install, concurrent git queries); publish results in `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`
- [ ] **Execution plan visualization**: before execution, show which steps will run in parallel (dependency graph rendered in the TUI and as a Rich table in CLI)
- [ ] **Parallel progress display**: when steps run concurrently, show live per-step status (running / done / failed) rather than a sequential list

---

## Phase 1.6: Agentic Harness Hardening ✅ — Completed April 2026

*Each entry is classified by **Impact** (H/M/L) and **Adaptation Difficulty** for Zenus (H/M/L)*

### 1.6.1 Hook Pipeline — PreToolUse / PostToolUse ✅ [Impact: H | Difficulty: M]

- [x] **PreToolUse hooks**: configurable shell callbacks invoked before any tool executes ✅
  - fnmatch pattern matching against `ToolName` or `ToolName.action_name`
  - Non-zero exit denies tool execution; all hook failures guarded so they never crash execution
  - Configured in `config.yaml` under `hooks.pre_tool_use[].match` + `command` + `timeout_seconds`
- [x] **PostToolUse hooks**: callbacks invoked after tool execution, run asynchronously (daemon thread) ✅
- [x] `/hooks` slash command: list all configured pre/post hooks ✅

### 1.6.2 Plan Mode ✅ [Impact: H | Difficulty: M]

- [x] **Plan-only execution mode**: proposes a rich table of steps and waits for user approval before executing ✅
  - `PlanModeManager` with `APPROVED` / `DENIED` / `BYPASSED` decisions
  - `auto_approve_low_risk`: skips prompt when all steps have risk=0
  - `/plan` slash command to toggle plan mode interactively in CLI and TUI ✅
  - Thread-safe singleton; integrated into `orchestrator.py` before `execute_plan()`

### 1.6.3 Context & Session Management ✅ [Impact: H | Difficulty: M]

- [x] **Context window compaction** (`/compact`): summarises history via LLM and replaces it with one entry ✅
  - Auto-triggered via `maybe_compact()` when token usage crosses `session.compact_threshold`
  - Fails gracefully if LLM is unavailable (history left unchanged)
- [x] **Multi-directory context** (`/add-dir`): add additional working directories to the active session ✅
- [x] **Session resume**: persist full session state to `~/.zenus/sessions/<id>.json` (chmod 600) ✅
  - `/session list/save/load/delete` shell commands; auto-prune to `max_sessions`

### 1.6.4 Background Task System ✅ [Impact: H | Difficulty: M]

- [x] **TaskOps tool**: `create`, `list`, `get`, `stop`, `output`, `purge` — full task lifecycle API ✅
  - Wraps existing `BackgroundTaskQueue`; accessible via `/tasks` command
- [x] **ScheduleOps tool**: cron job registration via `crontab`, with `# zenus-managed:<label>` sentinels ✅
- [x] **RemoteTriggerTool**: HTTP webhook trigger with URL scheme validation (http/https only) ✅

### 1.6.5 Git Worktree Support ✅ [Impact: H | Difficulty: L]

- [x] **WorktreeOps tool**: `enter(branch)`, `exit_worktree()`, `current()` — full worktree lifecycle ✅
  - `enter` calls `git worktree add` + `os.chdir()` into the isolated branch
  - `exit_worktree` checks for new commits; cleans up via `git worktree remove` if none

### 1.6.6 Developer Experience Primitives ✅ [Impact: M | Difficulty: L]

- [x] **`/doctor`**: 10-check system diagnostics rendered as a rich pass/fail table ✅
- [x] **ToolSearch tool**: search tool registry by name or description at runtime ✅
- [x] **AskUserQuestion tool**: formal tool for structured user input with options validation and retry ✅
- [x] **SleepTool**: agent-callable wait primitive, capped at 300 seconds ✅
- [x] **`/output-style`**: switch between `rich`, `plain`, `compact`, `json` rendering modes ✅

### 1.6.7 Skills Registry ✅ [Impact: H | Difficulty: M]

- [x] **User-extensible skill system**: auto-discovers `*.md` files with YAML front-matter as slash commands ✅
  - Discovery order: bundled → `~/.zenus/skills/` → `.zenus/skills/` → `skills_dir` config
  - `{args}` substitution in prompt body; appended when no placeholder present
- [x] **`/skills` command**: list skills, invoke by trigger, reload without restart ✅
- [x] **Bundled built-in skills**: `commit`, `review-pr`, `simplify`, `explain`, `test-coverage` ✅
- [ ] **MCP skill builders**: expose bundled skills as MCP tools — deferred to Phase 4.3

### 1.6.8 Jupyter Notebook Support ✅ [Impact: M | Difficulty: M]

- [x] **NotebookOps tool**: pure-JSON `.ipynb` manipulation without a kernel ✅
  - `list_cells`, `read_cell`, `edit_cell`, `add_cell`, `delete_cell`, `read_output`, `clear_outputs`
  - Validates extension and file existence; raises typed exceptions (ValueError, FileNotFoundError, IndexError)

## Phase 5.5: New Concepts Under Exploration

These ideas emerged during v1.x development and will be revisited when Phase 5 is underway. They are listed here to preserve the design intent, not as committed deliverables.

### Intent Versioning & Replay

- [ ] **Intent version history**: every `IntentIR` stored with a monotonic version ID
- [ ] **Replay any past intent**: re-execute a previous plan against the current system state
- [ ] **Diff two intents**: surface exactly what changed between two versions of the same goal
- [ ] **Time-travel debugging**: replay a failed execution step by step in a sandbox
- [ ] **Design note**: `IntentIR` is already serializable; the main work is a version store and a replay engine that can substitute observations from the past run with fresh ones

### Sandboxed Intent Simulation

- [ ] **Dry-run with state tracking**: simulate full execution in an isolated scratch space (tmpfs, namespace, or container) and report what would have changed
- [ ] **Blast-radius report**: before any destructive op, show exactly which files/services would be affected and by how much
- [ ] **Conflict detection**: detect if two pending intents would race on the same resource
- [ ] **Design note**: builds on `SandboxedAdaptivePlanner` already in place; extends it to return a structured diff rather than a yes/no

### Plugin & Extension System

- [ ] **Tool plugin API**: third-party tools installable as Python packages (`zenus-tool-*`), auto-discovered and merged into the registry at startup
- [ ] **Tool manifest**: each plugin declares its actions, risk levels, and privilege requirements in a `tool.yaml`
- [ ] **Sandboxed plugin execution**: plugins run with constrained permissions (no network by default, filesystem limited to declared paths)
- [ ] **Plugin marketplace**: curated index of community tools; `zenus plugin install <name>`
- [ ] **Design note**: the current registry is a flat dict — the main work is a discovery layer, a validation step (manifest + safety policy), and a reload mechanism compatible with hot-reload config

---

## Phase 6: Autonomy & Proactivity — target: by September 2027

### 6.1 Background Agent

  - Required for enterprise deployments behind corporate firewalls or data-residency requirements
  - Also enables local proxy for cost interception, logging, and rate-limit pooling across a team

- [ ] **Teleport / remote agent deployment** [Impact: H | Difficulty: H — from CC analysis]
  - `zenus teleport <host>`: install and launch a Zenus agent on a remote host over SSH, then control it from the local TUI
  - Zenus becomes the "nerve centre" and the remote instance becomes a worker
  - Foundation for Phase 7.1 fleet orchestration and the OS-layer agent model in Phase 10

- [ ] **Per-tool sandbox toggle** [Impact: M | Difficulty: L — from CC analysis]
  - `/sandbox-toggle`: flip sandboxing on or off for specific tools interactively during a session
  - Useful when a trusted plugin needs temporary elevated access without permanently changing privilege tiers
  - Decision is logged and expires at session end; never persisted silently

- [ ] **Kill Switches**
  - Emergency stop (Ctrl+C+C)
  - Panic mode (undo recent actions)

## Phase 10: Operating System Transition — target: by December 2028

This is the long-term ambition: Zenus evolving from a Python application into a system where the AI layer sits closer to the hardware. It is the most uncertain phase and will only begin once the upper layers are stable and mature. The architecture and language choices will be revisited when we get there.

### 10.1 Architecture Direction

**Current state (v1.x)**:
```
User → Python App (Zenus) → Linux → Hardware
```

**Target direction**:
```
User → Python AI Layer → Custom OS Services (Rust/C++) → Hardware
```

The Python layer keeps the AI and ML ecosystem. The lower layer provides tighter control over scheduling, memory, and security policies without the overhead of a general-purpose OS.

### 10.2 Migration Path

**Phase 10a: Design & Planning**
- [ ] Kernel architecture design
- [ ] Language selection (Rust vs Zig vs C++)
- [ ] Microkernel vs monolithic decision
- [ ] System call API design
- [ ] Python integration strategy
- [ ] Hardware support targets (x86_64, ARM, RISC-V)

**Phase 10b: Minimal Kernel**
- [ ] Boot loader implementation
- [ ] Memory management (paging, heap allocation)
- [ ] Process scheduler (basic round-robin)
- [ ] System call interface
- [ ] Basic I/O (keyboard, display)

**Phase 10c: File System & Drivers**
- [ ] VFS (Virtual File System) layer
- [ ] Simple file system implementation
- [ ] Disk and network drivers
- [ ] Basic TCP/IP stack

**Phase 10d: Python Runtime Integration**
- [ ] Embedded Python interpreter in userspace
- [ ] Python syscall bindings
- [ ] Port core Zenus modules to new platform
- [ ] Memory isolation between Python and kernel

**Phase 10e: Tool & Service Migration**
- [ ] Port existing tools (FileOps, SystemOps, etc.)
- [ ] Hybrid approach (Python orchestrates, kernel executes)
- [ ] Service management layer
- [ ] Multi-user support

**Phase 10f: Full OS Release**
- [ ] Complete OS installation ISO
- [ ] Bootable USB/CD image
- [ ] Graphical installer
- [ ] Hardware compatibility testing
- [ ] Documentation (user guide, developer guide)
- [ ] Migration tools from v1.x

### 10.3 Technical Decisions (to be made when Phase 10 begins)

**Kernel language candidates**: Rust (memory safety, growing OS ecosystem), Zig (simplicity, C interop), C++ (mature, proven)

**Kernel architecture candidates**: Microkernel (better isolation, easier to debug), Monolithic (performance, simpler), Hybrid (balance of both)

**Python integration options**: Embedded CPython (full compatibility, larger footprint), MicroPython (tiny footprint, limited stdlib), Hybrid (Python for AI, native for hot paths)

### 10.4 Risks

- Scope is large — realistically a 3+ year effort once started
- Requires kernel and systems programming expertise
- Hardware driver coverage is a major unknown
- Community fragmentation (v1 vs v2 users)
- Fallback: v1.x remains production-ready and will be maintained regardless

### 10.5 Backward Compatibility

- v1.x API compatibility layer planned for v2.0
- v1.x maintained for at least 2 years post-v2.0 release
- Clear migration guides and tooling before any transition
